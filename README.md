This is a portfolio website from float UI on which I expanded on and added tons of customization. To list some,

  - Added animations
  - Implemented dark mode feature
  - Fixed deprecated codes
  - Refactored the entire codebase
  - Pixel perfect responsiveness
  - Reusable codes for your next project too

Feel free to edit the contents and make it yours entirely.
